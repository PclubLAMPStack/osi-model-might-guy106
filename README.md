# 7 Layers of OSI Model

## Introduction
The OSI model is a conceptual model that characterizes and standardizes the communication functions of a telecommunication or computing system without regard to its underlying internal structure and technology.

## Services provided by each Layer
Each layer of the OSI model provides different services to the layer above it. Here are some of the services provided by each layer:

1. **Physical Layer**: This layer provides services such as bit synchronization and error detection.

>\# _This layer is responsible for transmitting raw bits over a communication channel._

2. **Data Link Layer**: This layer provides services such as framing and error control.

>\# _This layer is responsible for transmitting data frames over a communication channel._

3. **Network Layer**: This layer provides services such as routing and congestion control.

>\# _This layer is responsible for routing data packets between networks._

4. **Transport Layer**: This layer provides services such as end-to-end reliability and flow control.

>\# _This layer is responsible for providing reliable end-to-end data transport services._

5. **Session Layer**: This layer provides services such as session establishment and termination.

>\# _This layer is responsible for establishing, managing, and terminating sessions between applications._

6. **Presentation Layer**: This layer provides services such as data compression and encryption.

>\# _This layer is responsible for transforming data into the format required by the application layer._

7. **Application Layer**: This layer provides services such as file transfer and email.

>\# _This layer is responsible for providing network services to applications._

## Protocols
Each layer of the OSI model uses different protocols to perform its functions. Here are some examples of protocols used at each layer:

1. **Physical Layer**: Ethernet, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth
2. **Data Link Layer**: Ethernet, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth
3. **Network Layer**: IP, ICMP, ARP
4. **Transport Layer**: TCP, UDP
5. **Session Layer**: NetBIOS, RPC
6. **Presentation Layer**: JPEG, MPEG, ASCII
7. **Application Layer**: HTTP, FTP, SMTP
